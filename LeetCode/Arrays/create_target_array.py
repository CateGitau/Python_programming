"""
Given two arrays
 of integers nums and index. 
 Your task is to create target array under the following rules:

    - Initially target array is empty.
    - From left to right read nums[i] and index[i], 
    insert at index index[i] the value nums[i] in 
    target array.
    - Repeat the previous step until there are no 
    elements to read in nums and index.

Return the target array.

It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.
