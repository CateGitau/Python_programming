# Copy Linked List with Arbitrary Pointer

'''
We are given a linked list where the node has two pointers. 
The first is the regular next pointer. The second pointer is called arbitrary_pointer and it can point to any node in the linked list. 
Your job is to write code to make a deep copy of the given linked list. Here, deep copy means that any operations on the original list (inserting, modifying and removing)
should not affect the copied list.

Hereâ€™s an example of a linked list with arbitrary pointers connected.
