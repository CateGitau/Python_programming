'''
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, 
sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

    while white <= blue:
        if nums[white] == 0:
            nums[red], nums[white] = nums[white], nums[red]
            white += 1
            red += 1

            blue -= 1
